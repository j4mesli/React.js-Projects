## React-Playground
A small playground where I refreshed myself on React fundamentals like useState, props, refs, and more. 

## Tripago
A small playground where I refreshed myself on some React hooks like useEffect, useCallback, async hooks, and more.

## Magic-Memory-RTG
A simple memory game built on Vite, React, and TypeScript. The user loads into a game and attempts to match a matrix of face-down cards to one another. The game ends when all cards are flipped, with the users' total turn count and success rate displayed on the bottom of the screen.
