## React-Playground
A small playground where I refreshed myself on React fundamentals like useState, props, refs, and more. 

## Tripago
A small playground where I refreshed myself on some React hooks like useEffect, useCallback, async hooks, and more.

## Reaction-Time-Game
A game based off of The Human Benchmark that utilizes React, TypeScript, and Vite that measures the player's ability to quickly click on a panel when it flashes to GREEN after a random period of time. The game has the player react 5 times, then returns the average of all 5 attempts and outputs to the player whether or not their attempt was above or below the average human's reaction time (273ms).
